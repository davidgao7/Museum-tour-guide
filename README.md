## For developers who want to run it locally üßë‚Äçüíª

1. Always create a virtual environment before installing any dependencies

- `pyenv and venv for example`

```bash
# 1. install specific python version using `pyenv`
pyenv install [python version]
# 2. set the local python version 
pyenv local [python version]
# 3. create virtual environment with `venv`
pyenv exec python -m venv [venv name]
# 4. activate venv
source [venv_name]/bin/activate

# using current python:
pyenv exec python

# 5. install dependencies
pyenv exec pip install -r requirements.txt

# 6. run python file using current python:
pyenv exec python -m streamlit run api.py

# or you can directly run the file using the current python executable path:
# for example:
path_to_virtual_env/bin/python -m streamlit run TTS/api.py 
```
